            Edward Elliot’s Beach, also known as Bessy, is a popular and picturesque beach in the Besant Nagar area of Chennai, Tamil Nadu. It is named after Edward Elliot, a former governor of Madras, and has become one of the city’s most serene seaside destinations. Unlike the crowded Marina Beach, Bessie offers a quieter and more peaceful environment, making it ideal for morning walks, jogging, meditation, or simply enjoying the sunset. The beach is lined with cafes, restaurants, and small shops, making it a hub for food lovers and families looking for leisure activities. Nearby landmarks include the Ashtalakshmi Temple, the Velankanni Church, and several cultural and recreational centers. Local residents and tourists alike come to relax, socialize, or take part in beach activities such as volleyball and kite flying. The beach is well-maintained and attracts visitors throughout the year, reflecting Chennai’s blend of urban life and coastal charm. Its accessibility from central Chennai and surrounding neighborhoods adds to its popularity as a must-visit destination for anyone exploring the city.
