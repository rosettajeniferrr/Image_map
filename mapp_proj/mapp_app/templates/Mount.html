        <p> St. Thomas Mount is a historic and sacred site in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, named after St. Thomas, one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ, who is believed to have been martyred there in the 1st century AD. The mount is home to the St. Thomas Mount National Shrine Basilica, a hilltop church built by the Portuguese in the 16th century, which attracts pilgrims and tourists from across India and abroad. Visitors can climb a series of stone steps to reach the church, where they can see the Bleeding Cross, an ancient cross carved into the rock, believed by devotees to have miraculous powers. The hill offers panoramic views of Chennai city and the surrounding areas, including the nearby Guindy neighborhood and the Chennai International Airport. St. Thomas Mount not only holds religious significance but also represents the rich cultural and colonial heritage of the city, making it a popular destination for history enthusiasts, pilgrims, and casual visitors alike. The area around the mount has developed into a lively neighborhood with markets, educational institutions, and transport links, blending spiritual tradition with urban life.
